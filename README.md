# ComfyUI Loop Utilities

This is the [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) custom node for creating flows that needs to loop over multiple prompts one by one to generate images from different prompt in a single go.

## Nodes:

### Foreach Prompt
This node has two properties:
1. prompts_string
2. delimiter

Use the prompts_string to include a single large string where each prompt is seperated by delimiter.
Than connect the prompt output parameter as a text to the following node.

The next node with the rest of the flow will be invoked once for each of the prompts_string after split the string by the delimiter.

For example:

prompts_string:
```
This is prompt no. 1
---
This is prompt no. 2
---
This is last prompt no. 3
```

and the delimiter '---', the node will call the following node once with the prompt `This is prompt no. 1`, once with `This is prompt no.2` and once with `This is last prompt no. 3`.

The custom node installation guide below can usually be used for any custom node, you can use it in your README by modifying the repository name and URL.
